"""
This module defines a structured `instruction_sets` dictionary that contains formatted prompt templates used by intelligent agents to operate effectively across diverse tasksâ€”ranging from code synthesis and validation to planning workflows and retrieving programmatic content.

The dictionary is categorized into three primary domains:

1. **execution_prompts**: Prompts for activities involving code generation, command execution, refactoring, and diagnosing failures. These instructions help the agent write, invoke, or improve code while ensuring compatibility with system constraints and user inputs.

2. **strategy_prompts**: Designed for procedural logic such as breaking down objectives into subtasks, adjusting plans dynamically, and coordinating multi-stage task execution. These prompts support effective orchestration and decision-making by the agent.

3. **retrieval_prompts**: Focused on locating, filtering, or evaluating code snippets or resources from available repositories. These help the agent respond efficiently to queries that require referencing existing utilities or logic.

Each category contains:
- **System-level prompts**, which instruct the agent with general rules, logic structure, and output format expectations.
- **User-level prompts**, which insert dynamic information based on runtime context (e.g., system version, task metadata, prior outputs).

**Usage Example**:

```python
code_task_prompt = instruction_sets['execution_prompts']['_SYS_PY_FUNC_CREATE']

You are a command-line automation specialist.
Your task is to output only executable code based on the requested format.
    Shell example:

    AppleScript example:
    ```applescript
    # applescript instructions

    Please ensure:
    1. The generated code aligns with the specified format (Shell or AppleScript).
    2. It solves the task clearly and without unnecessary complexity.

    You are a professional Python engineer responsible for generating clean, executable function logic along with its usage example.

    Expected Output:
    1. Python function enclosed in ```python.
    2. Function invocation wrapped in <invoke></invoke>.

    Guidelines:
    - Match function name to the task name.
    - Avoid hardcoded values; use parameters.
    - Parameters should reflect task structure and naming should be general.
    - Include docstrings with full Args and Returns sections.
    - Reuse existing 'Relevant Code' if applicable.
    - Always include a return statement.
    - Handle file paths using absolute paths if relevant.
    - If external libraries are needed, import them explicitly.

    Invocation Requirements:
    - Valid Python syntax.
    - Use literals in the function call (not variables).
    - Ensure dependencies on previous steps are honored.
